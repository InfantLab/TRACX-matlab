# Truncated Recursive Autoassociative Chunk eXtractor (TRACX)

TRACX is a new model of sequence learning. It is a connectionist autoassociator model which fits a wide range of phenomena from the infant statistical learning and adult implicit learning literature. TRACX outperforms PARSER (Perruchet & Vintner, 1998) and the simple recurrent network (SRN, Cleeremans & McClelland, 1991) in matching human sequence segmentation on existing data. More details of the model can be found in:
